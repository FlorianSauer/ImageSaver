When should I use . . .

clean -df
You should use the defragment option when you do not want to query your storage more than necessary during
component downloads. When the content of a Compound changes multiple times, the new fragments will be added to
new Resources. This means that the querying of a compounds payload has to extract its fragments from multiple different
Resources. The worst case would be that each needed fragment is in a different Resource.

upload -ow -u
You should use this options when you repeatedly upload the same folder. this will only upload files, which do either not
exist on the remote side or were changed. in order to do this, a sha256 checksum is generated from each local file.
this means, that some files will be read two times; the first time to generate the checksum, and the second time
to read the file and generate fragments from it.
